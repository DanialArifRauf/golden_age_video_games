    "This analysis helped us identify the best years for video games by examining four key metrics: average critic scores, average user scores, number of games sold per year, and total sales per year. Our findings revealed certain years that stood out for their critical acclaim, strong user reception, and commercial success in the video games industry. While individual metrics highlighted different standout years, including more fields and categories helped us find the years with the most impact in gaming history. This approach provided a better look at the industry's peak periods and offered insights into when the video game marked reached its highest points in both quality and popularity."
