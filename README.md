<h1> Golden age of video games </h1>

In this data analysis project, I used SQL to explore video game data and identify the "golden age" of the industry. By analyzing metrics such as average critic and user scores, number of games released, and annual sales figures, the data helped us pinpoint the years when the industry thrived both in quality and popularity.

Data obtained <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/holmjason2/videogamedata">here</a> from Kaggle.com.
